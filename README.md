Wizlist is being developed during the Ragnarson's 2016 Internship program.

## Getting started:

### Dependencies:

We're developing in Ruby version `2.3.1`, and assume you have a working Ruby
environment and a PostgreSQL installed. On macOS you can install it using
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

    brew update
    brew install postgres

And on Debian based distros:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev

Update `rubygems` and install [`Bundler`](http://bundler.io):

    gem update --system
    gem update
    gem install bundler

App's dependencies can be installed by executing in app's root dir:

    bundle install

With all dependencies installed and the PostgreSQL running, we can set up our
database:

    bundle exec rails db:setup

### Development:

Running tests suite:

    bundle exec rails spec

Starting development server:

    bundle exec rails server
